# My Game Collection

This repository contains two games I have programmed. Each game is implemented in a separate file.

## Games List

1. **Tik Tak Toe**: A simple command-line program that allows two players to play a game of Tik Tak Toe.

2. **Rock Paper Scissors**: A command-line program that allows the user to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.

## Running the Games

Each game is implemented in a separate file and can be run independently. To run a game, simply navigate to the game's directory and execute the corresponding Python file.

## Contributing

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for any of the games, please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request. I welcome any contributions to improve the functionality, gameplay, or design of the games.
