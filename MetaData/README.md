# Picture Metadata Analyzer

This script allows you to analyze the metadata of an image file using the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and the ExifTags module.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Usage
1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script by typing `python meta_data.py` and pressing Enter.
4. When prompted, enter the file path of the image you want to analyze. Note that only image files are supported.
5. The script will output all available metadata for the specified image.

## Limitations
- This script only works with image files that contain metadata in the Exif format.
- The script does not provide any visual representation of the metadata. Instead, it outputs the metadata as text in the terminal or command prompt.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any errors while running the script, make sure you have installed the required dependencies and that the file path you entered is correct.
	-pip3 install Pillow
- If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to contact the script author.

## Acknowledgments
