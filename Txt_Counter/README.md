# File Counter

This is a Python script that counts the total number of words, lines, and characters in a given file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using `python3 file_counter.py`.
4. The script will ask you to input the path to the file you want to count. Enter the full path to the file.
5. Choose from the following options:
    1. Count the total number of words in the file.
    2. Count the total number of lines in the file.
    3. Count the total number of characters in the file.
    4. Count a specific word in the file (coming soon!).
6. The script will output the corresponding count based on your choice.

## Example

Suppose we want to count the number of words, lines, and characters in a file located at `/home/user/Documents/test_file.txt`. We would follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using `python3 file_counter.py`.
4. Enter the path to the file (`/home/user/Documents/test_file.txt`).
5. Choose from the following options:
    1. Count the total number of words in the file.
    2. Count the total number of lines in the file.
    3. Count the total number of characters in the file.
    4. Count a specific word in the file (coming soon!).
6. The script will output the corresponding count based on your choice.

## Notes

- The script currently supports only UTF-8 encoded files.
- If you choose to count the total number of words in the file, the script will treat words separated by a forward slash (/) as separate words as well.
- The option to count a specific word in the file is not yet available but will be added soon.
